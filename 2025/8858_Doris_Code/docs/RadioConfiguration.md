## Post Competition Radio Restoration Procedure

1. Turn Robot on so that Radio powers up
2. Ensure 2.4 GHz switch on back of radio is turned on
3. Connect an ethernet cable between `DS` port on radio and laptop

5. Set the team number to "8858"
6. *Optional* Set the SSID suffix to the name of the robot ("Doris" in our case).
   * This can help distinguish your robot from another robot being developed by the team which also likely uses "8858" as its team number
7. Change the password for the `WPA Key` for 6 GHz **and** 2.4 GHz.
8. Click "Configure" at the bottom of the screen.
9. A message saying "Success New configuration received and will be applied asynchronously." should appear on the page.
10. Turn on laptop's Wi-Fi and look for "FRC-8858-Doris".
11. Use the password set as `WPA Key` above to connect to the robot.
